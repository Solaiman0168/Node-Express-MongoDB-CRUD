Run this command to initialize a Git repository (skip this step if Git is already initialized)

git init

Add all files in your project to be tracked by Git:

git add .

(Optional) Check the status to verify the files added:

git status

Commit the files with a descriptive message:

git commit -m "Initial commit"

Create a New Repository on GitHub

Add Remote Repository in Git Bash

Copy the repository URL from GitHub (it will look like https://github.com/username/repository-name.git).

In Git Bash, set the remote URL:

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

Verify the remote URL (optional):

git remote -v

Push your code to GitHub:

git push -u origin main

Push your code to GitHub:

git push -u origin main

Note: If your branch is named master instead of main, replace main with master above.

Verify on GitHub

Go to your GitHub repository page, refresh it, and you should see your code uploaded.

For subsequent changes, you can just add, commit, and push with:

Stage your changes:
git add .

Or add specific files
git add filename.extension

Commit with a message:
git commit -m "Updated code"

push the branch
git push


To push your commit to the origin remote, use the following command:
git push origin <branch-name>





This guide should get your project live on GitHub! Let me know if you encounter any issues during the process.
