To merge the develop branch into main, youâ€™ll need to follow these steps in Git Bash:

Switch to the main Branch
git checkout main

Pull Latest Changes from main
git pull origin main

Merge develop into main
git merge develop


Resolve Conflicts (if any)
If there are any conflicts, Git will notify you. Open the conflicted files, resolve the conflicts, then stage the changes:
git add .

Commit the Merge
After resolving conflicts (if any), commit the merge:
git commit -m "Merge branch 'develop' into 'main'"

git commit -m "Merge branch 'develop' into 'main'"

Push the Updated main Branch to GitHub
Finally, push the merged main branch to your remote repository:

git push origin main
